# Extra Credit Attempts

## Attempted extra credits options are: 
* IPv6 Support and Testing
* Matching Number of Threads to Number of Cores
* Full-Loop Lookups
* Benchmarks: Results in benchmarks.txt indicate around 2x the amount of cores there are. Used a benchmarking function that simulated cores and different amount of threads.
