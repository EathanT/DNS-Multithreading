Each EC (Extra Challenge) is linked to the following:
* 1) IPv6 Support and Testing
* 2) Matching Number of Threads to Number of Cores
* 3) Full-Loop Lookups
* 4) Benchmarks: Results in benchmarks.txt indicate that around the max amount of threads possible is the ideal number of threads(typically 2 threads per core). Used a benchmarking function that simulated cores and different amount of threads.
* 5) POSIX Conditional Variables
* 6) POSIX Conditional Variable in C++11 or newer
